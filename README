Primative system for translating MIDI input to a score,
and reading a text file of notes and transcribing them to a score.
MIDI input is based on computer keyboard QWERTY layout, and 
score output prints in ascii characters to console.

Note: console must be full screen for this to work, ridiculous, but fun!
